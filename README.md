Current priority:

- [x] - Parsing the data in Python 
    - [ ] - Make a function to be able to display this data

- [ ] !- Using numpy, pandas to build data frames
    - [Tutorial for this](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/create-a-dataframe-from-a-numpy-array-and-specify-the-index-column-and-column-headers/)
    
- [ ] !- Using Matplotlib or Seaborn to plot the data and the frequency
    - [Tutorial for this](https://medium.com/ml-with-arpit-pathak/data-visualization-using-matplotlib-and-seaborn-in-python-62fd64a57936)

- [ ] ?- The plotted data should be load cell data, as well as wind parameters such as aws.
    - Ask for samples of data when the code is elastic enough to change it

- [ ] - Make a query that will help with NOT accounting the last value as it's always empty (even when testing and putting in sample data last value was 'None')

- [ ] - Jupyter Notebook integration (Basic point graphs)

- [ ] - Function to get the data from database with choosing exact data, if not then print out the whole
